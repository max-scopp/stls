Various STLs I made for various things.


## RSP-500 PSU Brackets.stl

This is the stock Ender 5 Plus PSU and intended to be attached to an DIN3 Rail.

## Rotated Generic 80 LED PSU Brackets.stl

This should work with many cheap PSUs, I made it specifically for this one:

It intended to dangle off 2/3 of the rail. It's not ideal, but works well enough.
For a stronger part, use `Generic 80 LED PSU Brackets.stl`
